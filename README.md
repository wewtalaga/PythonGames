Newbie in Python creating small and simple games to learn the language more

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello there! I'm currently learning Python and the best way to do 
so is to make practical applications. The only language that I know is 
C++ and ABAP (is this even a language? lol). There'll be mistakes
along the way and if ever you find one, you are free to message me.

Thanks! :)
